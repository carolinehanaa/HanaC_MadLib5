This program is a pretty basic madlib program that meets all the requirements for the assignment.
It gives the user multiple inputs to form the parts of the story, gives the user the story with their inputs inserted in to it, and then gives the user the option to restart the program, checking if they type 'yes' or 'no', looping the end until they type on of those.
